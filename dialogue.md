## Dialogue by Map

### Map 2: Town of Endgame

#### Agi Lecoach

I work with all the teams and it's unbelievable

how different

they are!

The brass hangs out in Mahogany Row. They act like

they're the adults in the room but they're just people.

Our SREs call themselves Team Marathon. They built us

one of the best platforms I've ever seen. And yet, we still have

incidents.

Team Inferno usually delivers except most of the

time it doesn't work right.

Team Disco tries so darn hard but their velocity is

all over the place.

#### Paws Alljohn

GAME OVER MAN!

Haha not really. These folks have the best

SREs and infrastructure money can buy, and they still have

incidents!

My implants are all messed up so I need you to help

these folks out with a retrospective. Get the story and show them

the way.

#### Boba Jacobian

Nyaanager runs a Westrum generative team. She doesn't

call it that though. This is the way.

#### Casey

If you know who I am I don't know why you're surprised

to find me here.

#### Courage

Fixing the database schema was intense. Just thinking

about it gives me cognitive zoomies!

It's a full moon, the sky is clear, and I love coding.

We're writing Rust tonight boys. Awooooooo!

#### Desi Goner

The Boss from Team Inferno sent me here to finish up

the critical user journeys for themes or something?

I asked all these people what the feature is

and got 19.2 answers!

#### Frau Barella

The great style unification of 2021 is the greatest

achievement of our career!

Customers still complain about usability. It's like.

Our stuff is great, but it doesn't quite come to gether.

#### Glenn Gary

How am I supposed to sell this product when it

keeps crashing in front of prospects!?

Inferno talks a big game but really their customers

are stuck with us so they put up with it. Our reputation is

not great.

The Disco geeks always deliver, eventually. They're

never on time and releases are rough. They're always too busy

to talk.

I hear the SREs are pretty good but I only know them

from incidents, so it's hard for me to tell.

I talked to Mahogany peeps and they say everything is

fine. It is in fact, not fine. Except for Marathon, I don't get it.

#### Johnny Mnemomena

I never sleep anymore. No matter how many times

I train these fools, they keep writing bugs!

Obviously this is proof that we need more training.

#### Nanny Ogg Vorbis

nothin' over 'ere cept broken dreams and burnouts

It's not that bad, I just haven't done anything with this

part of the village yet :)

#### Tenchi

We all love our work but we're having trouble with our velocity.

We recently split up some of the projects to work on

more independently, so we could keep up with the incoming requests.

As Polly Math predicted, they just asked for more and more

so we're all lonely and it's hard to help each other now.


### Map 3: End

#### Agi Lecoach

I work with all the teams and it's unbelievable how different

they are!

The brass hangs out in Mahogany Row. They act like

they're the adults in the room but they're just people.

Team Inferno usually delivers except most of the

time it doesn't work right.

Team Marathon's velocity has been a straight line for

3 quarters straight. That must be world record.

They make it look so easy.

Team Disco tries so darn hard but their velocity is

all over the place.

#### Cary Erguy

I talk to the customers so the engineers don't have to.

I'm a people person!

#### Casey

If you know who I am I don't know why you're surprised

to find me here.

#### Cee Eeoh

Pandora opened up a lead for us. The customer loved

the dark mode mockup.

I double clicked on that vision and had an epiphany.

What if customers could theme the whole site!? Should be easy.

I was so excited I texted my guy on Team Inferno. He

dropped everything and started work on it right away.

#### Cody

Stories are never ready for us to work on so I spend

all my time chasing requirements.

#### Paws Alljohn

GAME OVER MAN!

Haha not really. $#@@*** this though. I gave them the best

Kubers and somehow they always have excuses for their outages.

Can you find the root cause for me?

No.

#### Desi Goner

The Boss from Team Inferno sent me here to finish up

the critical user journeys for themes or something?

I asked all these people what the feature is

and got 19.2 answers!

#### Devo Pestorius

Our CI/CD is amazing, I should know. So why the

heck are we so slow!?

I hate how everyone hides behind their counter and

expects me to make everything work in the end.

#### Doctor McFire

Coordinating tricky incidents is like slaying as a lead guitar

on stage.

You get in the zone, time flies by, and then

it's over and your mind buzzes for hours.

#### EV003

The Endgame of SRE

Amy Tobey | @renice@hachyderm.io

Assets by VisuStella

#### Frau Barella

The great style unification of 2021 is the greatest

achievement of our career!

Customers still complain about usability. It's like.

Our stuff is great, but it doesn't quite come to gether.

#### Gantt

Why is it so hard for these meatbags to understand our

SDLC? They call it Waterscrumfall, whatever that means.

These fools write down stories in messy English.

Hah! One thing at a time, that's the way!

#### Glenn Gary

How am I supposed to sell this product when it

keeps crashing in front of prospects!?

The Marathon dudes are always taking days off

and laid back. Somehow, their product sells itself.

The Disco geeks always deliver, eventually, but they're

never on time and releases are rough. They seem so busy it makes

no sense.

Inferno insists they're the best because they work so

hard and that part seems true. Thing is, their software isn't

usable so it's hard to sell.

#### Hidaslo Xela

I know I'm not supposed to gloat but the error budget

alert was the first to fire and we were on it before customers

noticed.

#### Kirito

I started here months ago and it's like this isekai

I watched where the guy has no powers and the starting

town hates him.

しょうがないね。That sounds either hilarious or horrible. I met

The Boss and Tenex so I'm guessing horrible.

I really need to hit a year at this place or my

resume's gonna tank.

#### Leah Dev

I can't take it anymore! Can I tell you a secret?

Tenex breaks things all the time and I have to clean

up after him so he can "innovate".

I'm interviewing around so I can have a life again.

Imagine The Boss's face when there's yet another

incident and I'm not here to save the day!

#### Luna

I paired with my bestie, Ocean today. I used to be

skeptical about pairing but it was a blast!

It was going great and then we had an incident. We

weren't involved but we overheard it was going on and couldn't

look away.

#### Managear Greg

As the manager, I protect my people from the politics of

this place.

My director says I always have to have a plan for

every problem so we're kinda stuck. I don't know what to do.

#### Merc

I just go with the flow. I get paid either way so who

am I to complain? My rate's the same for nonsense as it

is for good work.

Who goes to work to be happy? I'm here for the money.

Now I must go, I just got a new ticket to work on.

#### Mistress of Scrum

We are forming a tiger team to implement the new

Pantone values right away.

#### Nyaanager Evie

We had a tricky incident today so I took the pager

and told my team to scram. Maybe this is weird but I'm excited

for the retro!

Sure, I could get another

hour or two out of them. If they're happy next week, we'll make it

up and then some.

#### Ocean

I'm not the best programmer and Luna's not the

best tester. As a pair we kick butt.

It's almost as if we and the computers and the code

all become one in the simulation.

Heh, sorry. I don't know if it's the

cybernetics papers or Trek fics that make me this way.

#### Pandora

I finally did it! I showed the customer my sweet

a dark mode demo and they demanded we build the before they'll

talk about a deal.

Our service doesn't really need themes but

I knew this prospect would love it.

#### Polly Math

I need to fix this bug then check in the code I started

this morning but then BAM! an incident and tests to fix and patch

my kernels

Why would you bring up ADHD?

#### Rick

I got a few hours of solid coding in today and

Nyaanager told me to take off. It's a full moon tonight. She's so

thoughtful!

#### Robert Bob

Team Disco's velocity is 40 points and I think they

can do better so I always assign them 50 or more.

#### Seventh Daughter of Nine

Timelines are the hardest part of the incident for me to

write up so I'm getting a start on it.

I'm glad the team has the weekend to process. They

tell me everything because I treat the stories they tell as sacred.

Oh, look at me prattling on. You should talk to Nyaanager

Evie!

#### Shelly the Intern

These guys aren't paying me enough. They aren't paying me

anything!

I try to work but I don't even have access. I pass the

time on my phone and I feel awful about it.

#### Tenchi

We all love our work but we're having trouble with our velocity.

We recently split up some of the projects to work on

more independently, so we could keep up with the incoming requests.

As Poly Math predicted, they just asked for more and more

so we're all lonely and it's hard to help each other now.

#### Tenex

I don't get why these lazy jerks complain so much.

I worked 100 hours last week and look at me! I'm fine.

Mahogany Row loves me! They come straight to me with

the most important work. Planning is for nerds.

Team Disco tries but they can't keep up with me.

Even when The Boss makes sure they work on my stories first they

still screw it up.

Those geeks in Team Marathon go home at 5 o'clock

every day. I heard they had an incident though, haha, serves

'em right.

#### The Boss

These darn Millenials don't want to work. When I was

a developer I hustled every hour of every day.

I did my time and got promoted. Now I make sure people

are working. It's hard job but someone has to keep the

pressure on.

Everyone calls me Boss because I get things done

no matter what. Business before bros, am I right?

#### The Director

Glad you stopped by. I know you're trying to focus

on this sociotechnical thing but...

with your skills you could be an asset to the team!

OK FINE. Can you look in on Team Inferno? I know Disco's

struggling but I worry more about how The Boss is driving his team.

#### Vee Peapod

I heard Cee Eeoh needs a new color wheel in the app so

I told Team Disco to get that ready as soon as possible.


### Map 4: Team Marathon

#### Boba Jacobian

Nyaanager runs a Westrum generative team. She doesn't

call it that though. This is the way.

#### Courage

I committed a buffer overflow fix right before Evie

rang the bell. I still have the cognitive zoomies so I'm going to

write some Rust!

It's a full moon, the sky is clear, and I love coding.

Awooooooo!

#### Doctor McFire

On-call is such a rush. One minute you're typing away

and the next you're the incident commander.

When I went from the SLO alert to traces I immediately

knew I screwed up. Rolling forward was just as easy as

rollback so I cut a pull request.

Some people complain but I love incidents.

I should write a paper about them, that would be cool.

#### EV009

This shelf seems to be dedicated to

the complete works of Chuck Tingle. LOVE IS REAL is engraved in the

wood.

#### Hidaslo Xela

I know I'm not supposed to gloat but the error budget

alert was the first to fire and we were on it before customers

noticed.

Nobody else is doing SLOs yet. I believe SLOs will help

the Disco push back on Mahogany Row and keep Inferno honest.

#### Luna

I paired with my bestie, Ocean today. I used to be

skeptical about pairing and now I'm one of THOSE PEOPLE.

Nyaanager and Ocean were so paitent with me while I

got the hang of it. I look forward to it now.

#### Nyaanager Evie

We had a tricky incident today so I took the pager

and told my team to scram.

I love my team and they totally rock. I do my best to

protect them but the pressure from Mahogany Row is getting to me.

I can't get promoted without driving my team harder

and I know in my toebeans that it would halt their growth.

#### Ocean

I'm not the best programmer and Luna's not the

best tester. As a pair we kick butt.

It's almost as if we and the computers and the code

all become one in the simulation.

Heh, sorry. I don't know if it's the

cybernetics papers or Trek fics that make me like this.

#### Seventh Daughter of Nine

Oh yeah, we had an incident. I only know the gist

of it right now. We'll do interviews

next week after the team has processed a bit.

Xela was bragging about the error budget

so we're comparing it to the timeline to incident estimate

customer impact.


### Map 5: Team Disco

#### Cody

Stories are never ready for us to work on so I spend

all my time chasing requirements.

#### Devo Pestorius

Our deploys are so solid that people keep asking me to

work on other things.

What they don't realize is that it takes a lot of work

to keep it that way!

#### Dom

I talk to the customers so the engineers don't have to.

I'm a people person!

#### Isabella

Am I going to get fired!?

We're so far behind. They keep giving

us more work than we can do. I feel stretched to

my limit!

#### Managear Greg

My people work so hard and it feels like we just

cant win. I really hope this retro will help.

#### Polly Math

I need to fix this bug then check in the code I started

this morning. That incident really threw me off my groove.

Managear says my promotion isn't looking good because I

don't close enough tickets. Everything would fall to pieces without

me!

Why would you bring up ADHD?


### Map 6: Team Inferno

#### Leah Dev

I can't take it anymore! Can I tell you a secret?

I'm interviewing around so I can have a life again.

Tenex breaks things all the time and refuses to

add distributed tracing every time I ask.

Every incident is like hunting for

a needle in infinite haystacks. I like to imagine their faces

when I resign.

#### Merc

I just go with the flow. I get paid either way so who

am I to complain? My rate's the same for nonsense as it

is for good work.

#### Kirito

I started here months ago and it's like this isekai

I watched where the guy has no powers and the starting

town hates him.

I really need to hit a year at this place or my

resume's look terrible.

Maybe I can transfer to Team Marathon but they almost

never have openings.

#### Shelly the Intern

These guys aren't paying me enough. They aren't paying me

anything!

The Boss brought in a new developer metrics tool to

figure out our quality problems...

He berated me for my mean time to review metric. So

Leah stamps all my commits now to keep him happy.

#### Tenex

I worked 100 hours last week. I get free food here so why

would I go home?

Oh, that incident? I told those nerds in Team Disco

that I was reading their tables.

They said something about schema changes blah blah

blah but I zoned out.

#### The Boss

These darn Millenials don't want to work. When I was

a lad we wrote COBOL and we hustled and look at me! I turned out

fine.

The security bots are on my case about so-called

vulnerabilities. I threatened the team with termination if they

write bugs, so that's fixed.


### Map 7: Mahogany Row

#### Cee Eeoh

Pandora opened up a lead for us. The prospect loved

the dark mode mockup. I, I mean we, need that logo.

I double clicked on that vision and had an epiphany.

What if customers could theme the whole site!? Should be easy.

I asked Vee Peapod to get started right away!

#### Directrix Tina

Oh hey Amy, glad you stopped by. I asked Managear Greg

to be accountable for the incident but he keeps coming back with

excuses.

#### Mervin

I made a perfect waterfall plan for the feature, precise

down to the story point and millisecond. Not that anybody cares.

#### Mistress of Scrum

Team Disco complained bitterly when I reshuffled their

sprint. It's not like I can tell Vee Peapod no, right?

#### Pandora

I finally did it! I showed a prospect my sweet

a dark mode demo and they demanded we build the before they'll

talk about a deal.

#### Robert Bob

Team Disco's velocity is 40 points and I think they

can do better so I always assign them 50 or more.

#### Story 1

The API must implement fuzzy search for all attributes.

Cardinality is someone else's problem.

#### Tier 0

This one should be easy. We just need to implement

pagination for the database records.

#### Vee Peapod

Cee Eeoh needs a new color scheme in the app so

I told Team Disco to drop everything and get it done.

They complained about interrupting their sprint but

I'm going for a promotion and this will win it for me.


### Map 9: Team Marathon - Retro

#### Paws Alljohn

GAME OVER MAN!

Haha not really. $#@@*** this though. I gave them the best

Kubers and somehow they always have excuses for their outages.

Can you find the root cause for me?

No.

#### Cody

#### Courage

rang the bell. I still have the cognitive zoomies so I'm going to

#### Vee Peapod

I heard Cee Eeoh needs a new color wheel in the app so

I told Team Disco to get that ready as soon as possible.

They complained about interrupting their sprint but

I need to impress the board to get more headcount.

#### retro dialog

Thanks for helping us with this incident Amy. It

seems simple technically, but I know in my toebeans there's

more to the story.

I'll summarize the incident to make sure we're all on the

same page.

Now, let's talk about contributing factors!

I feel terrible about letting the deploy hang around

half-failed. It's worked flawlessly for so long I think I

just assumed production was fine.

It happens to all of us Isabella. From what we've heard,

it sounds like your team is saturated. Accidents are inevitable!

Can we monitor for broken schemas?

I added failed migration detection to the pipeline

before the incident was over. This won't happen again.

I realize we've been pushing the team pretty hard. I'm

going to push back harder on Mahogany Row when they push for more

than we can do.

You're coddling them. It's your team so whatever.

Are we going to talk about how your change broke our

product!?

Tooting my own horn here, but without those error budget

alerts we would have been down longer.

I haven't done live DDL updates like that in years.

It was invvvvvigorating!

Team Disco was surprised by something they've never

seen before, an unknown unknown.

When these folks used their expertise to

diagnose and manually revert, that was adaptive capacity in

action.

Wait a minute Paws. Is that the resilience stuff you're

always talking about?

Yep. Exactly. Adaptive capacity in action is resilience.
